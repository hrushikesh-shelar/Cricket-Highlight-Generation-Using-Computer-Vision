# In this paper, we propose an algorithm to generate cricket highlights using the computer vision techniques. 
In order to do so, we apply Convolutional Neural Network and Optical Character Recognition methods. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect the start of each ball which is a classification model. The dataset for classification is manually designed from the frames of one of the videos scraped for the purpose of the paper. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used for reading the scoreboard and also to help detect the start of each ball.
