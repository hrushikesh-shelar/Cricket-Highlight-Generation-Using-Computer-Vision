### Keywords:
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Optical Character Recognition(OCR)


### Method:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Classification:
       Classifying the start-of ball frame for video segmentation into short clips.
2. OCR for reading scoreboard:
        Used OCR for reading scoreboard to determine occurence of the event. This will help us chose the events for highlights.
